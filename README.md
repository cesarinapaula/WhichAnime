# WhichAnime
Welcome to WhichAnime, your guide to discovering new anime!

WhichAnime was built using ReactJS, ExpressJS, and PostgreSQL.  The chatbot was built using React-Simple-Chatbot. The main outside API used was Kitsu API.

Users have several options to choose from: search by genre; search by keyword; and the option to receive a random anime. There is also a kids-friendly search option to look for titles that are appropriate for younger children. 

Future updates will include:
1) A special search for Studio Ghibli films.
2) Extended kids-friendly section.
3) Additional filter options for more specific search queries.
4) Resources page that will include news and blog links, where to watch, and conventions/events.
5) Rotating background image.
6) Anime of the Day section.
